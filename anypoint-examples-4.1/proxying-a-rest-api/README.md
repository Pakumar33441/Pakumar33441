# Proxying a REST API #

This example shows how to proxy your API. Applications send service requests to your proxy, which in turn calls the real API.

### Assumptions ###

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule and the [Anypointâ„¢ Studio interface](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Studio+Essentials). To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more [Anypoint Studio Tutorials](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Basic+Studio+Tutorial). Further, this example assumes that you have a basic understanding of [Mule flows](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Mule+Application+Architecture) and [Mule Global Elements](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Global+Elements).

Furthermore, this document assumes that you have a REST API that has not been built to run on Mule ESB
 


### Example Use Case ###

To demonstrate the basic procedure of creating a proxy application, this document uses the public Box API as an example REST API to stand in for any REST API that you have that you might want to proxy through a Mule application. The specific configuration for Box is summarized here, but you will need to replace this with the corresponding information for your own RESTful services that you wish to proxy.

### Set Up and Run the Example ###

To follow along with the steps in this example, you must have a [box.com](https://app.box.com/files) account, which you can create for free if you don't already have one.

#### Registering an App in the Box Developer Portal ####

The steps below are only needed in this particular example so that you can test your finished proxy for the Box API by simulating an API call from an application. They don't necessarily match the steps you need to carry out to test your own API.

1. Go to Box's developer portal: [developers.box.com](https://developers.box.com/)
1. If you do not have an account, you need to create one [here](https://app.box.com/signup/personal). If you have one, click **My apps** in the upper-right corner of the [page](https://developers.box.com/).
2. Click **Create a Box Application** in the panel on the right. Give it any name, such as MyProxy, then select the **Content API**. 
1. Click **Configure Application**.
1. Look for the *client_id* and the *client_secret*. Copy these to a safe place, as you will need them later.
1. Add a *redirect_url*. For the purpose of this exercise, any https URL will do, even https://www.google.com.

Leave the box developer portal open for now, as you will return here later to request an OAuth token. Because the OAuth token expires very quickly, it's best to build the flow before you request it.

If you're using HTTPS, as the Box API requires, you must create a keystore file to certify the communication. This can be done using the keytool provided by Java, found in the bin directory of your Java installation. Navigate to this directory on your machine using the command line, then execute the following command to create a keystore file:

		keytool -genkey -alias mule -keyalg RSA -keystore keystore.jks

You will be prompted to create two passwords. Remember these. The command creates a .jks file in the local directory called keystore.jks. Drag this file into the */src/main/resources* directory in Mule Studio's Package Explorer.

#### Building the Proxy in Studio ####

Next, build your proxy application in Mule Studio. Your proxy application needs to:

1. Accept incoming service calls from applications and route them to the Box API.
1. Copy any message headers from the service call and pass them along to the Box API.
1. Disable the default status code exception check to allow any error messages that the Box API returns to be passed on to the application. 
1. Capture message headers from the Box API's response and attach them to the response message.
1. Route the response to the application that made the service call.

The following steps describe how to obtain a token for the Box API and use it to test the proxy you have just built by simulating an API call from an application.

1. Firstly, open proxying-a-rest-api.xml in Anypoint Studio. Replace the values *${keystore.key}* and *${keystore.password}* with the corresponding data you entered while creating keystore using the commandline - see the previous section.
2. In your application in Studio, click the **Global Elements** tab. Double-click the HTTP Listener global element to open its **Global Element Properties** panel. Change the contents of the **port** field to required HTTP port e.g. 8081 
3. Deploy your Mule Project to the embedded Mule server by right-clicking the project in the Package Explorer, then selecting **Run As... > Mule Application**.
4. In any Web browser, enter the following URL: 

		http://localhost:8081/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<CLIENT_ID>

	Replace <CLIENT_ID> in the URL above with the client_id provided by Box when you registered your new app.
5. Box will prompt you to log in with your username and password. You can use your personal credentials or create a new test account.
6. Before you click **Grant access to Box**, you should be ready for the following steps, as the token code you will obtain will expire in only 30 seconds.
Be ready to send **http://localhost:8081/oauth2/token** as an HTTP **POST** request that includes a body with the properties below:

		Attribute		Value
		grant_type		authorization_code
		code			<fill this in during the next step>
		client_id		<client_id provided by Box when you registered your app>
		client_secret	<client_secret provided by Box when you registered your app>

	To send this request, use a browser extension such as [Advanced Rest Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo) (Google Chrome), or the [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) command line utility. 

7. Once you have prepared for the next step, go back to the browser page where you entered your Box credentials and click **Grant access to Box**.
8. The browser is redirected to the page you set as the redirect on your Box app. For this exercise, the page itself is irrelevant, but the full URL will include an extra parameter named code. For example:

		https://www.bing.com/?state=&code=<CODE>

9. Copy the value of &lt;CODE&gt; from the URL and paste it into your POST request so that its properties are the following:
	
		Attribute		Value
		grant_type		authorization_code
		code			<code provided by redirect URL>
		client_id		<client_id provided by Box when you registered your app>
		client_secret	<client_secret provided by Box when you registered your app>
10. Send the request.
11. This POST request returns a JSON object with several fields. Copy the value corresponding to *access_token*, as you will need it soon. The *access_token* lasts for an hour before expiring.
12. Now you can make proper requests to your proxy. You must include *access_token* on every request as a header with the name Authorization.

		Header			Value
		Authorization	Bearer <access_token>

	The value of the header must include the word Bearer followed by a space and then the access_token. For example:
	
		Authorization=Bearer 1234123412341234

Try making a **GET** request to [http://localhost:8081/2.0/folders/0](http://localhost:8081/2.0/folders/0), remembering to include the Authorization header. 

### How it Works ###

Follow the anatomy described here to build a proxy application in Mule Studio that abstracts your API to a new layer. Your proxy application needs to:

1. Accept incoming service calls from applications and route them to the URI of your target API.
1. Copy any message headers from the service call and pass them along to your API.
1. Avoid passing internal Mule headers both to the API and back to the requester.
1. Add a flag that ensures that your target API's HTTP status codes are returned to the requesting app, and not overwritten by the proxy's own status codes.
1. Capture message headers from your API's response and attach them to the response message.
1. Route the response to the application that made the service call.

### Documentation ###

Studio includes a feature that enables you to easily export all the documentation you have recorded for your project. Whenever you want to share your project with others outside the Studio environment, you can export the project's documentation to print, email or share online. Studio's auto-generated documentation includes:

- A visual diagram of the flows in your application
- The XML configuration which corresponds to each flow in your application
- The text you entered in the Notes tab of any building block in your flow

Follow [the procedure](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Importing+and+Exporting+in+Studio#ImportingandExportinginStudio-ExportingStudioDocumentation) to export auto-generated Studio documentation.
